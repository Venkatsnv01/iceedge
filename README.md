Hello All, I've created a simple website for my favourite restaurant Ice Edge Cafe using HTML,CSS and JavaScript as a part of DAA task1 submission.
This site is best compatible with desktop window

There's two pages, page 1 is home and page 2 is login page.
The files for home page is Index.html and  style.css and for login page is login.html, login.css and app.js
